## Opcodes

An "opcode" is the action the CPU carries out against the opcode's operands  
The Nintendo Gameboy's processor is a modified Intel 8080-style Sharp CPU called the LR35902
It is similar to the Z80, and uses a lot of the same assembly instructions

Structure of disassembled/assembly instructions:

<address> <opcode> <mnemonic> [<operand> ...] [; commentary]
Note that some opcodes don't have any operands and some have more than one
